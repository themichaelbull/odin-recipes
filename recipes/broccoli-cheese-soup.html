      <li>4 cloves garlic, minced, divided</li>
      <li>1 cup chopped onions</li>

      <li>2 cups half-and-half</li>
      <li>2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
      <li>2 cups chicken broth</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 175 degrees celsius. Line a baking pan with a silicone mat.</li>
      <li>Toss broccoli and olive oil together in a bowl. Transfer to the prepared baking pan.
          Sprinkle 1/2 of the minced garlic over top.</li>
      <li>Roast in the oven until broccoli is tender, 15 to 20 minutes, tossing occasionally.</li>
      <li>Meanwhile, combine remaining garlic and onions in a food processor; pulse until
          onion is chopped. Change to the shredding disc and grate carrots into the bowl.</li>
      <li>Melt 1 tablespoon butter in a medium skillet over medium heat.
          Add onion-carrot mixture to the skillet and saute until tender, 5 to 7 minutes.
          Remove to a plate.</li>
      <li>Add remaining 4 tablespoons butter to the same skillet.
          When melted, slowly stir in flour. Slowly stir in half-and-half, then stir in chicken broth.
          Simmer until thickened, 10 to 15 minutes.</li>
      <li>Slowly drop in Cheddar cheese; add cooked vegetables and roasted broccoli;
          simmer for 5 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
