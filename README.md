Repo for the Odin Recipes Project

This repo is to create a basic recipe website.

The goals here are to show my understanding of basic HTML knowledge. Both the initial boilerplate HTML and some of the further basics.

This includes things like:

- HTML Boilerplate
- Different types of HTML elements and tags
- Working with text, lists, links and images

Let's go!
